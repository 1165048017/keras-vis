# Keras Visualization Toolkit

Aims to be a general toolkit for:
- Caricaturization (deep dream)
- texture style transfer
- Activation maximization
- Neural style transfer
- Any other image backprop

Code generalizes image backprop problems as energy minimization problem. 
Framework inspired from paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02017v3.pdf

Very much a WIP. Currently, only activation maximization works.
